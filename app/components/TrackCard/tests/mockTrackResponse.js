      longDescription:
        "Harry, Ron and Hermione set out on their perilous mission to track down and destroy the Horcruxes--the keys to Voldemort's immortality. On their own, without the guidance or protection of their professors, the three friends must now rely on one another more than ever. But there are Dark Forces in their midst that threaten to tear them apart. Meanwhile, the Wizarding world has become a dangerous place for all enemies of the Dark Lord. The long-feared war has begun and Voldemort's Death Eaters seize control of the Ministry of Magic and even Hogwarts, terrorizing and arresting anyone who might oppose them. But the one prize they still seek is the one most valuable to Voldemort: Harry Potter. Harry's only hope is to find the Horcruxes before Voldemort finds him. But as he searches for clues, he uncovers an old and almost forgotten tale--the legend of the Deathly Hallows.",

        "Shock, controversy and pathological rage are the order of the day with Eminem (Marshal Bruce Mathers the III - aka Slim Shady) . In a short few months, he became one of the most provocative, outrageous, and obsessive rappers in contemporary music. As Eminem rocks the rap world, the hip hop community greets him with open arms and rock stations and the fans just can't get enough.<br /><br />This is not an artist or record company music release, and sound quality varies due to the nature of recordings. This Eminem audiobiog is a unique and exclusive recording of one of the biggest music success stories of the millennium.<br /><br />Described as sarcastic, offensive, foul mouthed, his cynical outlook on life has struck a chord with millions of rap fans. Every collector, fan and music historian must have this."
